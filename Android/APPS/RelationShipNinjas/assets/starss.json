Starting with only three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and coffee, the company opened its first retail store in Brooklyn, NY, on November 15, 1976 and then offered franchises throughout the United States and 54 other countries around the world. Häagen-Dazs produces ice cream, ice cream bars, ice cream cakes, sorbet and frozen yogurt. The company that sells Häagen-Dazs products in the US is located in Oakland, California.\nThe ice cream comes in many different flavors and is a \"super-premium\" brand, meaning it is quite dense (very little air is mixed in during manufacture), uses no emulsifiers or stabilizers other than egg yolks, and has a high butterfat content. Häagen-Dazs is also meant to be kept at a temperature that is substantially lower than most ice creams in order to keep its intended firmness.","10:00 AM",""],

The item was a great success and 25 million T-shirts were sold in a few years. It was a great success for the five business men from Campania, who started off thinking of a clothes company and ended up with a successful business, currently operating in Italy and abroad.\nOnly ten years after they started, the founding members set out on a new adventure: retail sales. In 1993 they inaugurated the first, single-brand store. Only four years later there were over 100 stores, Original Marines franchises, all over Italy.\nCurrently Original Marines stores can be found all over the world – there are over 600 single-brand stores and 66 of them are abroad.","10:00 AM",""],

Susie and Doug Tompkins were driving through California in a station wagon full of their homemade fashion. They sold these items of clothing in an unconventional manner – from the backseat of the vehicle. The very first customers were already excited about this new fashion because they sensed the special charm and the lifestyle hiding behind it. And thus, the hour of birth of one of the most successful lifestyle brands in the world reflected precisely what its name says: Esprit.\n\nToday, more than ever, Esprit is an international, young brand that offers its customers the smart, affordable luxury of constantly being able to enrich their life with something special and some- thing new, which always corresponds to the current tastes and styles. This lifestyle concept is the central point of the Esprit philosophy. The brand uses this to constantly communicate to its customers the security and guidance that they want on today’s markets, which are saturated by increasingly short-lived trends. Thus, it is no wonder that Esprit ranks among the brands with the highest level of repeat purchases, i.e. those with the most loyal regular customers. And this has nothing to do with age, but is more about this joint attitude, this feeling of togetherness that characterises the Esprit target groups.","10:00 AM",""],

Donburi literally means “rice bowl” in Japanese. The word has evolved from being the name of an object that is used to serve steamed rice, to being the name of a classic array of Japanese dishes. Donburi dishes typically consist of steamed rice topped with either chicken, meat, fish, vegetables or other ingredients which can be boiled, grilled, fried or even raw. Unlike western fast food, Japanese cuisine is free of dairy fat. Cheese, butter and cream are normally known to be very high in saturated fats. Our menu sticks to a 100% dairy-free variety of delicious meals, keeping most donburi meals at a very low fat content. Our cooking concept acts not so much to change the raw ingredient by smothering it in spices or sauces, but rather to enhance its natural flavor and compliment it with fluffy white rice that is freshly steamed every day. Our steamed rice maintains the sticky, chopstick- friendly characteristic and contains even less calories than sushi rice! Donburi is a simple, balanced and nutritious meal that brings traditional Japanese cuisine to the fast food counter and also shows that there is much more to Japan than just sushi. Rice bowl toppings can vary according to season, climate, location and local taste, so there is always a favorite donburi for everyone! Itadakimasu!","10:00 AM",""],

In fact, many locals argue that Abou El Sid is one of the only real Egyptian restaurants, celebrating local favourites often shunned in favour of other Oriental dishes.\nStepping into the restaurant The secluded Abou El Sid takes you away from the modern Cairo its like entering a quirky Cairo dining room from the 50’s, with a careful display of chandeliers, , colourful rugs and large wooden tables covered with copper trays. The days of Umm Kalsoum spring to mind, from design and food, to the music played. Which inspires the restaurant’s concept to serve true and tasty local cuisine for friends and family.\nAs for the food, all of Abou El Sid’s starters are great and very authentic, that gives you the true Egyptian feel .Even though their menu is not oversaturated with items, the masterfully prepared dishes are able to satisfy even the choosiest gourmand. The service can easily qualify as a five-star.","10:00 AM",""],
